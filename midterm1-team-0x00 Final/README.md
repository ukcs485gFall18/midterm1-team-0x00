# IRegex
Description and functionality: Utilizes regular expressions to validate user input and has a search and replace function.

Original Capabilities: Creates an account for the user and allows the user to search for specific words in their "supervillain diary."

Added Functionality: We added the ability to search for a specific iteration of the searched for word in the textfield which was to be highlighted green, and then the ability to skip through each iteration of that word. We also added the ability to verify simple math expressions.
